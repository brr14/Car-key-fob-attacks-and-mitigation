# Types of key fob attacks
(a) Relay attack-A key fob attack happens when a device is used to pick up a radio signal from nearby key fob and relay it to another car.<br/>
(b) OBD port- hacking the port and accessing information and manipulating the corresponding car key codes to get desired results.<br/>
(c) Keyless jamming- This method allows the hacker to block the signals coming from the key fob making the owner think that they have locked it when in reality the signal never went to perform the command.<br/>
(d) This are ways of of exploiting cars without actually having to break into it.<br/>

# Ways to mitigate key fob attacks
(a) Using an app which tells you whenever the vehicle is in ignition.<br/>
(b) Storing the key fob in a faraday bag which blocks electromagnetic signals therefore making it harder for the hacker to access car key codes.<br/>
(c) Turn off keyless fob's wireless signal.<br/>
(d) Using a car alarm.<br/>
